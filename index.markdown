# About the course

For this project-based Service Design Studio course, students form teams to respond to a “Service Design Challenge”. They conceptualize, design, code and deploy a new Artifical Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) based application.

Students will learn:
 * web technologies
 * agile ways of working and SCRUM
 * Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
 * AI/ML solutions available as Application Program Interfaces (APIs)

 The course is managed in a tripartite collaboration involving SUTD, a Technology Expert Company, and Industry.
 
 During the [Summer of 2022]({% link summer2022/1_2022.md %}) run, Google was Technology Expert company. About 9 industry projects were done by the students. Students deployed their project on Google Cloud's services: Cloud Run, Cloud Build, Cloud SQL, and used GCP's AI/ML API-s.

# Curriculum overview

Course pre-requisites:

* 10.014 Computational Thinking for Design (Term 1)
* 50.004 Introduction to Algorithm (Term 4)
* Suggested elective in Term 3: 10.020 Data Driven World

In the first half of the course, students learn various web technologies, service design tools, as well as AI-enabled tools from both SUTD faculty and guest lecturers. The Industry will provide the problem statements and the first half the term will be used to scope the project that students will do.

In the second half of the term, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) application will be deployed. Students will meet regularly with supervisors from Industry and the mentors from Technology Expert company. 

The course ends with demo of the project deliverables to both Industry, Technology Expert company, and SUTD communities.
