## Students' Feedback

> "We got a mini experience what its like doing a full project with agile." -- Anonymous

> "I loved that it is a project heavy module, very relevant for me to test out and practice real world skills instead of memorizing theories and regurgitating them. This is the reason I joined SUTD - doing practical, hands on things which I enjoy a lot honestly." -- Lim Hng Yi

> "Topics studied and practices used in the project are very relevant for software engineering. Constant communication is something that SUTD students rarely get experience with, and this course really had a lot of that with our company mentors, which I liked alot" -- Anonymous

## Note From Google Staffing Team

Google built this partnership with SUTD to bring more Google Cloud awareness to the students on campus. Through this course, students gained hands-on experience with Google Cloud and it also contributed to building their skills for a potential career in Cloud! Refer [here](https://careers.google.com/students/) for full-time or internship opportunities with Google Cloud!

In addition to campus partnerships, Google also provides different Google Cloud certification pathways for students and individuals who are keen to upskill themselves in this space. Whether an individual is new to Cloud, or looking to further their existing Cloud knowledge, there are different pathways available to meet different learning needs. Refer [here](https://cloud.google.com/certification) for more information!
